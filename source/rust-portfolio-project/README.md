# ðŸ“ˆ Rust Portfolio Project

When learning how to invest I got the idea to create my own way of tracking my investments. I've created the basic spreadsheet but I want to do analysis with my own custom methods. This is where Rust comes in to create a multi-platform application to do just that. I can potentially create it as a web app hosted on justinleahy.com
